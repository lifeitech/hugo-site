      <description>[03.01] Zelenskyy wants his own safety guaranteed on the clash: â‘  no chance of security guarantee to Ukraine from Trump because that means putting the US on the very frontline with Russia for nothing. â‘¡ To Zelenskyy, the mineral deal is almost a dishonest prelude of partition. In the event of invasion, American workers can be retreated timely and safely, leaving him and his country at risk.
This is really a tough situation for Ukraine.</description>
